## Introduction
Hello! This is Disha, the creator of this project. In this project, I have designed a system that allows users to calculate the total resistance, current, voltage drops, and visualize a circuit design involving resistors in series and parallel connections. 

### Features
This project allows users to perform the following actions:

1. Enter the number of resistors: The user can input the number of resistors in the circuit.
   
2. Enter the value of resistors: The user is prompted to input the resistance values of each resistor in the circuit. 

3. Choose series connections: The user can choose which resistors to connect in series. The total resistance of the series connection will be calculated accordingly.

4. Choose parallel connections: The user can select resistors to be connected in parallel. The total resistance of the parallel connection will be calculated as well.

5. Confirm after reviewing the connections: Once the resistors have been connected in series and parallel, the user is asked to confirm the setup.

6. Get total resistance, current, and voltage drop: After confirming the circuit, the system calculates and displays the total resistance of the circuit, the total current flowing through it, and the voltage drop across each resistor.

7. Get the circuit design: The system visualizes the circuit design based on the series and parallel connections made by the user.

## How to Use:
   
1. Enter resistor values: After specifying the number of resistors, you will need to input their individual resistance values.

2. Make series and parallel connections: You will be asked to choose which resistors to connect in series and which to connect in parallel.

3. Confirm connections: Once you have selected the connections, the system will display the total resistance of the circuit, the current, and the voltage drop.

4. Circuit Visualization: Finally, you can view the design of the circuit showing the connections in series and parallel.
