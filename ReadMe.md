## Introduction
Hello! This is Disha, the creator of this project. In this project, I have designed a system that allows users to calculate the total resistance, current, voltage drops, and visualize a circuit design involving resistors in series and parallel connections. 

### Features
This project allows users to perform the following actions:

1. Enter the number of resistors: The user can input the number of resistors in the circuit.
   
2. Enter the value of resistors: The user is prompted to input the resistance values of each resistor in the circuit. 

3. Choose series connections: The user can choose which resistors to connect in series. The total resistance of the series connection will be calculated accordingly.

4. Choose parallel connections: The user can select resistors to be connected in parallel. The total resistance of the parallel connection will be calculated as well.

5. Confirm after reviewing the connections: Once the resistors have been connected in series and parallel, the user is asked to confirm the setup.

6. Get total resistance, current, and voltage drop: After confirming the circuit, the system calculates and displays the total resistance of the circuit, the total current flowing through it, and the voltage drop & current  across each resistor.

## How to Use:
   
1. Enter resistor values: After specifying the number of resistors, you will need to input their individual resistance values.

2. Make series and parallel connections: You will be asked to choose which resistors to connect in series and which to connect in parallel.

3. Confirm connections: Once you have selected the connections, the system will display the total resistance &current  of the circuit, the current, and the voltage drop at each resistor .
